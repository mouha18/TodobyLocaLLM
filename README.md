This project is a private, high-performance To-Do application built with a local AI stack. Utilizing an RTX 4050 GPU via LM Studio and AnythingLLM, it employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to index the codebase. This allows the AI to suggest context-aware refactors and features entirely offline.
